#Fantasy Oscars
>In this brief note directly under the title, I would like to acknowledge the relative frivolity of this project. Since it's a frivolity I'll be engaged with regardless of my excuse, I'm going to commit myself to making this Rails implementation as robust and delightful as possible. At the very least, it'll bring down the net time I devote, annually, to making a fantasy sports game out of the Oscars...

The solution: 
**Fantasy Oscars for all!**

**My MVP:**
* Has *commissioners*, who sign up for authenticated accounts and may interact with the CRUD operations of the *ballots* model. 
* Has *players*, who may join a league via a unique url, and must provide an email address they may create one *ballot* each.
* Has a *commissioner interface*, which allows the *commissioner* to visually interact with their *ballots*
* Can collect and evaluate valid *ballots* according to the rules the developer sets for the game.

**Areas of Interest**
* Minimizing the role of passwords in an environment where the stakes are low.
* Creating a robust and reusable framework for a game designer.
* Cultural punditry through the Oscars game - the game as self-expression.
* Replicating standard social dynamics in software.
